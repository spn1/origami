              <p>Ah, computer dating. It&apos;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &quot;upside your head.&quot; I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Are you crazy? I can&apos;t swallow that.</p>
              <p>Well I&apos;da done better, but it&apos;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I&apos;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
